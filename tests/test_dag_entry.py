"""ENTRY MUST NEVER RECEIVE A HOP.

ENTRY is the address the ThorChain memo names, in plaintext, in a Bitcoin
OP_RETURN -- so anyone who reads the BTC chain has it. build_entry_veil calls
the output sitting on it "THE ONE OUTPUT AN ANALYST GETS FOR FREE", and the
veil's entire premise is that ENTRY is spent ONCE, into a fresh carrier, and
then abandoned. Every transaction after that spends an output no outsider can
enumerate.

The hop graph broke that. `dag` was built over all of `subs`, which contains
ENTRY, and assign_hop_destinations prefers a source's own adjacency
(`dag.get(s, mix_targets)`), falling back to the ENTRY-free `mix_targets` only
when the adjacency is exhausted. So the exclusion was written, and the primary
path went around it: a MIXED output was paid back to the publicly-named address
in roughly nine runs out of ten, at every size measured.

That also made the exit's ENTRY hold fire on the wrong thing. The hold exists
to stop a late swap chunk being swept from ENTRY straight to --exit-to; with
the hop graph feeding ENTRY, what it actually caught, most of the time, was
mixed value that had been sent home.

Driven, not read: these checks build the real adjacency and run the real
assignment. A source grep would pass on a graph that excluded ENTRY from the
keys but not the values.
