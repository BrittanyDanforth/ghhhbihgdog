"""THE FORWARDER, DRIVEN: it plans, it signs, it never broadcasts.

btc_forwarder is the vault-side stage-2 tool. It is run here through its
real main() with only the network stubbed -- the look at the deposit
address, the SwapKit quote, the price oracle, THORNode -- and every claim
is checked against the file it writes and the transaction inside it:

  * the happy path signs a transaction that an INDEPENDENT verification in
    this file accepts, pays the inbound exactly the settled amount minus the
    fee, carries the memo in an OP_RETURN laid out correctly, spends every
    settled output with RBF on, and is marked broadcast: false;
  * the quote is requested for EXACTLY the amount sent, in fixed notation;
  * THE MEMO DOES NOT FIT: on the default 80-byte policy every real forward
    is refused with the byte count, and only a raised policy lets it sign;
  * every refusal fires by its kind and signs nothing: unbound memo, wrong
    network, bad checksum, nothing settled, no fee estimate, fee out of
    band, fee eating the deposit, below the minimum, below the mix floor,
    a deviating quote, a THORNode mismatch or halt, a missing/invalid/
    wrong seed, no constant-time backend;
  * the seed comes from the environment only, is removed from it, and
    appears in neither the plan file nor the output;
  * what the hash chain gets is kinds without a digit in them.
